    "But how can we talk precisely about what goes in to functions and what comes out? You have already met a bunch of different kinds of objects in Python: `1`, `2.55`, `True`, `\"red\"`, `None`. Each of these has a **type**. When we talk about what goes in to functions and what comes out, we won’t talk about particular inputs (who cares if you double `7` or `9`? The point is you can’t double `False`). We’ll talk about the types of objects that functions operate on. Everything has a type. Here are a few **types** that you already know:\n",

    "| `float` | `1.1115`, `9.08` | Decimal numbers. They’re called `float` because of [how they are stored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) |\n",
    "| `str`   | `“apple”`, `“x”` | Strings, or sequences of characters. Careful! `5` is an `int` but `\"5\"` is a `str`.                                               |\n",
    "| `bool`  | `True`, `False`  | Booleans, or True/False values. Named for George Boole, who spent a lot of time thinking about them.                              |\n",

    "> Every type is also a function which turns its argument into that type, if it’s possible. So `int(3.33333)` becomes `3`, `str(True)` becomes `\"True\"`, and `bool(0)` becomes False. But `int(\"j\")` is an error, because there’s no sensible way to turn `\"j\"` into an `int`. Python’s attitude toward types is pretty casual; even if something is not quite the right type, we’ll make it work if we can. Other languages are much stricter, requiring every variable to specify its type, and requiring every function to specify what type it accepts and what type it returns. There are tradeoffs, and you’ll probably develop an opinion on which you prefer once you learn a few more programming languages."

Verbs are action words, and transitive verbs are actions that have a subject and an object, something that acts and something that gets acted upon. For example, you can’t just “annoy,” you have to annoy someone or something. Same with “cancel” and “chase.” So to make a full `VerbPhrase`, we need to comine a `TransitiveVerb` with the `NounPhrase` it acts on.\n",
